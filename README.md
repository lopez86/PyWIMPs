# WimpSim
Python Tools For Dark Matter Direct Detection Simulation &amp; Analysis

This repository is under construction, but I intend to have tools such as:

-Monte Carlo simulation of WIMP recoil energy distributions and recoil energy/direction distributions

-Calculation of astrophysics parameters such as the mean WIMP direction and WIMP rates over time (for sidereal and annual modulation searches)

-Calculation of cross section limits using several different methods

-maybe more (coupling constant limits, examples using publicly-available datasets, lists of good readings for people interested in dark matter detection, etc)

The goal is for the code here to all be in Python 3 with standard Python packages such as NumPy and SciPy. I might make a ROOT interface but the core code should be independent of ROOT. This ensures that the code will be easy to install and use by non-experts.
